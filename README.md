# Data Analyst Python Track Final Project-Business Decision Research
Hi there!

This repository is my final project for Data Analyst Python Track at DQLab Academy. I have been taken this course in May - August 2023. 

## Overview of Data Analysis Pipeline
### 1. Theoritical Test: 
 - This test is intended to test understanding of data analytics.

### 2. Coding Test: Data Preparation:
 - Importing `data_retail.csv` into python environment, cleaning and modifying the data so that it is ready to be used for further analysis.

### 3. Coding Test: Data Visualization:
 - Get insight from the visualization results that have been made. The data visualizations created include:
   - Customer acquisition by year,
   - Transaction by year,
   - Average transaction amount by year,
   - Proportion of churned customers for each product,
   - Distribution of transaction count categorization,
   - Distribution of average transaction amount categorization.

### 4. Coding Test: Modelling:
 - Get insight from the model and evaluate the model that has been created and tested with a final accuracy result of 66%.

## Run `Data_Analyst_Project_Business_Decision_Research.ipynb` File
You can run the file by following these steps:
1. Download the `Data_Analyst_Project_Business_Decision_Research.ipynb` file.
2. You can use your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory, but in here I use Google Colaboratory to run the file.
3. Upload and select the `Data_Analyst_Project_Business_Decision_Research.ipynb` file.
4. Click the `Connect` button at the top right corner to connect to a hosted runtime.
5. And then you can choose `Runtime` and run all the code cells.
